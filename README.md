### An investigation project for SISR.  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14335">[Paper]</a> 

### This repository is an official project of the paper "From Beginner to Master: A Survey for Deep Learning-based Single-Image Super-Resolution". 

## Purpose

<font color='red'>Due to the pages and time limitation, it is impossible to introduce all SISR methods in the paper, and it is impossible to update the latest methods in time. Therefore, we use this project to assist our survey to cover more methods. This will be a continuously updated project! We hope it can help more researchers and promote the development of image super-resolution.Â Welcome more researchers to jointly maintain this project!</font>

## Abstract

Single-image super-resolution (SISR) is an important task in image processing, which aims to enhance the resolution of imaging systems. Recently, SISR has made a huge leap and has achieved promising results with the help of deep learning (DL). In this survey, we give an overview of DL-based SISR methods and group them according to their targets, such as reconstruction efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and perceptual accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce the problem definition, research background, and the significance of SISR. Secondly, we introduce some related works, including benchmark datasets, upsampling methods, optimization objectives, and image quality assessment methods. Thirdly, we provide a detailed investigation of SISR and give some domain-specific applications of it. Fourthly, we present the reconstruction results of some classic SISR methods to intuitively know their performance. Finally, we discuss some issues that still exist in SISR and summarize some new trends and future directions. This is an exhaustive survey of SISR, which can help researchers better understand SISR and inspire more exciting research in this field.

## Real-World SISR

The degradation modes are complex and unknown in real-world scenarios, where downsampling is usually performed after anisotropic blurring and sometimes signal-dependent noise is added.  Recently, some new technologies have been proposed, such as unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning, zero-shot learning, meta-learning, blind SISR, and scale arbitrary SISR. In this part, we introduce the latter three methods due to their impressive foresight and versatility.

## Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution

With the development of satellite image processing, remote sensing has become more and more important. However, due to the limitations of current imaging sensors and complex atmospheric conditions, such as limited spatial resolution, spectral resolution, and radiation resolution, we are facing huge challenges in remote sensing applications.

## Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution

In contrast to human eyes that can only be exposed to visible light, hyperspectral imaging is a technique for collecting and processing information across the entire range of electromagnetic spectrum. The hyperspectral system is often compromised due to the limitations of the amount of the incident energy, hence there is a trade-off between the spatial and spectral resolution. Therefore, hyperspectral image super-resolution is studied to solve this problem.

## Light Field Image Super-Resolution

Light field (LF) camera is a camera that can capture information about the light field emanating from a scene and can provide multiple views of a scene. Recently, the LF image is becoming more and more important since it can be used for post-capture refocusing, depth sensing, and de-occlusion. However, LF cameras are faced with a trade-off between spatial and angular resolution. In order to solve this issue, SR technology is introduced to achieve a good balance between spatial and angular resolution.

## Face Image Super-Resolution

Face image super-resolution is the most famous field in which apply SR technology to domain-specific images. Due to the potential applications in facial recognition systems such as security and surveillance, face image super-resolution has become an active area of research.

## Medical Image Super-Resolution

Medical imaging methods such as computational tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential to clinical diagnoses and surgery planning. Hence, high-resolution medical images are desirable to provide necessary visual information of the human body. Recently, many methods have been proposed for medical image super-resolution

## Depth Map Super-Resolution

The depth map is an image or image channel that contains information relating to the distance of the surfaces of scene objects from a viewpoint. The use of depth information of a scene is essential in many applications such as autonomous navigation, 3D reconstruction, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality. However, depth sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect and Lidar, can only provide depth maps of limited resolutions. Hence, depth map super-resolution has drawn more and more attention recently.

## Stereo Image Super-Resolution

The dual camera has been widely used to estimate depth information. Meanwhile, stereo imaging can also be applied in image restoration. In the stereo image pair, we have two images with disparity much larger than one pixel. Therefore, full use of these two images can enhance the spatial resolution.

## Video Super-Resolution

As an emerging medium, video has attracted increasing attention owing to its ability to carry more information. Specifically, the video consists of multiple images, and each frame is an image, so it can provide more scene information. However, it is difficult to obtain high-resolution video due to the limitations of the network transmission and device storage. Therefore, video super-resolution (VSR) technology is essential. For VSR, multiple frames provide much more scene information, thus full use of the inter-frame temporal dependency (e.g., motions, brightness, color changes) is beneficial for high-quality video reconstruction.
