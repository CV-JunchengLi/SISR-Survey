## Abstract

Single-image super-resolution (SISR) is an important task in image processing, which aims to enhance the resolution of imaging systems. Recently, SISR has made a huge leap and has achieved promising results with the help of deep learning (DL). In this survey, we give an overview of DL-based SISR methods and group them according to their targets, such as reconstruction efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and perceptual accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce the problem definition, research background, and the significance of SISR. Secondly, we introduce some related works, including benchmark datasets, upsampling methods, optimization objectives, and image quality assessment methods. Thirdly, we provide a detailed investigation of SISR and give some domain-specific applications of it. Fourthly, we present the reconstruction results of some classic SISR methods to intuitively know their performance. Finally, we discuss some issues that still exist in SISR and summarize some new trends and future directions. This is an exhaustive survey of SISR, which can help researchers better understand SISR and inspire more exciting research in this field. 

## Purpose

Due to the pages and time limitation, it is impossible to introduce all SISR methods in the paper, and it is impossible to update the latest methods in time. Therefore, we use this project to assist our survey to cover more methods. This will be a continuously updated project! We hope it can help more researchers and promote the development of image super-resolution.
